# Ez Mode - Pond0x Automation Extension

![Ez Mode Logo](icon48.png)

**Ez Mode** is a browser extension designed to automate mining and swapping activities on [Pond0x](https://www.pond0x.com/). With version 4.2.0, this extension provides a seamless experience for users looking to optimize their mining and swapping operations with minimal manual intervention. Featuring a user-friendly control panel, detailed status tracking, and smart automation features, Ez Mode is your go-to tool for efficient Pond0x interactions.

-  **Wallet interation**: Note the extension does not connect to your wallet, and does not create any non native Pond0x signatures or touch your private key or seed phrase.

## Known Issues

- **Page Load Delays**: If the Pond0x page takes too long to load, the extension may timeout. It will attempt to proceed but some features might not work.
- **Invalid Unclaimed Values**: If the mining page shows invalid unclaimed values (e.g., “100k”, “1m”), the extension will reload the page to recover itself with no interation needed
- **Swap Button States**: If the swap button gets stuck (e.g., “loading…” or “pending”), the extension will reload the page after a timeout.
- **Network Issues**: The extension checks for network connectivity and reloads the page if disconnected.
